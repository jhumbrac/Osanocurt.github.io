<ul>
<li>chance to get your hands on rare sold out items</li>
<li>appreciate some of your favourite players and moments in the beautifull game</li>
<li>add to your own colllection for the right price</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting football boots has been a passion of mine since i first borrowed to use my brothers pair of boots that were way too big for me, Since then i have always had the curiousity to know what brand make the best boots, i have tried out pretty much every brand or style football boots that have ever been made, some not even for the public, I was lucky enough to have played the beautiful game professionally and with it i have some great moments and achievements that no one can ever take from you,


 What is your favourite moment in sport? what colour kit were you wearing? what stadium did you play at? what boots were you wearing? Was it a goal scored or was it a goal saved? Did you win? What did that moment mean to you and why? this site is to wake up these moments within you, through out my playing carrear i have found no better boots and memories than when i wore the older style football boots.
