</ul>
<p>Collecting football boots has been a passion of mine since i first borrowed to use my eldest brothers pair of boots that were way too big for me, Since then i have always had the curiousity to know what brand make the best boots, i have tried out pretty much every brand or style football boots that have ever been made, some not even for the public, I was lucky enough to have played the beautiful game professionally and with it i have some great moments and achievements that no one can ever take from you,


 What is your favourite moment in sport? what colour kit were you wearing? what stadium did you play at? what boots were you wearing? Was it a goal scored or was it a goal saved? Did you win? What did that moment mean to you and why? this site is to wake up these moments within you, through out my playing carrear i have found no better boots and memories than when i wore the older style football boots, the ones where you see David Beckham put a free kick in the top corner. Ronaldo running through a whole team on his own and scoring some unreal goals, Drogba in his prime bullying defenders, and Thiery Henry scoring some incredible goals.

 There are endless stories and players that can be mentioned but this is just a short list of my own memories to share with you all. </p>
